## Description

- Using both Html and CSS learned assets to create my first website
-for html we installed a lot of images as well as used href and anchors to have the links working correctly\
-for html we also made sure to add img alt to the tags
-css we used boxing and a lot of design to create the layout
-css I also use @meida to make sure the website is the same when minimized.
-css I also made sure to add a reset.css to ensure the website is the same for each platform browser and mobile


## Installation

-I used a lot of the class code to get started from weeks one and two to create a website. It was a lot of coping and pasting exactly what I needed as well as understanding what it was used for
